About
=================================
This web application was created for [Hack Cleveland](http://www.hackcleveland.org/)'s 2015 #Fix16 event.

The app parses throught these minutes, sorts them by committee, and provides the following pieces of data for each meeting:
* Date
* Council members absent
* Whether public opinion/input was provided
* The public opinion/input
* Events / Resolutions
